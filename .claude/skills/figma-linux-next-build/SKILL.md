  Build, packaging, and release skill for the figma-linux-next project.
  Use this skill when working on: creating releases, bumping versions, building packages (deb/rpm/pacman/AppImage/zip/snap), CI/CD workflows (.github/workflows/), AUR packages, or any publishing/distribution task. Also use when asked to "build", "release", "package", "publish", or "ship" figma-linux-next.

# figma-linux-next Build & Release Reference

## Quick Commands

```bash
bun run build          # Vite build → dist/ (required before packaging)
bun run pack           # Full release build: clean → build → electron-builder all targets
bun run pack:pacman    # Pacman-only package
bun run pack:snap      # Snap-only package (needs snapcraft + LXD/Multipass; see Package Targets)
bun run builder        # electron-builder only (skips Vite build)
bun run local:install  # Install to /opt/figma-linux-next for manual testing
bun run cln            # Clean dist/

# Release prep (run on staging, NOT on dev)
perl scripts/bump_version.pl 0.13.4   # bump version + commit + tag on staging
# NOTE: bump_version.pl reads current version from latest git tag (not package.json)
# After running, verify package.json and src/package.json have correct version
# If they don't match, fix manually:
#   sed -i 's/"version": "OLD"/"version": "NEW"/' package.json src/package.json
#   git add package.json src/package.json && git commit --amend --no-edit
#   git tag -d vNEW && git tag -a vNEW -m "Publish vNEW release"

perl scripts/generate_release_notes.pl --latest        # markdown preview
perl scripts/generate_release_notes.pl --latest --html # Flathub HTML format
```

## Build Pipeline

```
bun run build
  1. bun run cln                          → rm -rf dist/
  2. vite build                           → dist/main/main.js + dist/renderer/
  3. cp src/package.json dist/package.json
  4. bun install --production (in dist/)  → dist/node_modules/

bun run pack
  1. All of the above
  2. chmod +x resources/AppRun
  3. electron-builder --linux             → build/installers/
```

Build outputs go to **`build/installers/`**, not `dist/`.

## Package Targets

Configured in **`config/builder.json`**:

| Format | Arch | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DEB | x64, arm64 | `libgtk-3-0`, `libnss3`, `libdrm2`, `libgbm1` deps |
| RPM | x64, arm64 | `gtk3`, `nss`, `libXtst` deps |
| Pacman | x64 only | No arm64 variant for Arch repos |
| AppImage | x64, arm64 | Uses `resources/AppRun` launcher |
| ZIP | x64, arm64 | Portable archive, uploaded to GitHub Releases |
| Snap | x64, arm64 | `snapcraft` key, `base: core24`, `confinement: strict`, `gnome` extension (implicit) + explicit `plugs` (`home`, `network`, `network-bind`, `unity7`, `audio-playback`, `pulseaudio`, `browser-support` w/ `allow-sandbox: true`). Needs `snapcraft` CLI + an isolated build env (`useLXD: true` set in config) |

App ID: `app.borys.FigmaLinuxNext` — registers `.fig` file association and `figma://` protocol.

**Snap builds are not free-standing.** Unlike deb/rpm/AppImage/zip (fpm or direct packing),
the `snap` target shells out to a real `snapcraft` CLI, which needs an isolated build
environment — LXD (container, no nested virt) or Multipass (VM). `config/builder.json` sets
`snapcraft.core24.useLXD: true`, matching what `release.yml`'s `build-snap-*` jobs provision
via `canonical/setup-lxd@v1`. Building locally requires `sudo snap install snapcraft --classic`
plus a working LXD (`sudo snap install lxd && lxd init --minimal`). Without both, packaging
fails fast with `snapcraft not found` / `spawn snapcraft ENOENT` — that failure mode is
expected in any sandbox without snapd, not a config bug.

**Runtime confinement (strict, not classic/`--no-sandbox` — not an option for this app).**
`config/builder.json`'s `snapcraft.core24.plugs` sets an explicit list, which replaces
electron-builder's defaults entirely (see `resolvePlugs()` in
`app-builder-lib/dist/targets/linux/snap/core24.js`) — anything not listed there, and not
supplied by the `gnome` extension itself (`desktop`, `desktop-legacy`, `gsettings`, `opengl`,
`wayland`, `x11`), is silently absent from the built snap, with no build-time warning.
Dropping `network` this way once shipped a snap that couldn't resolve DNS or open a socket.

`browser-support` with `allow-sandbox: true` is required for Chromium's own internal sandbox
(userns) to work under strict confinement — without it, `figma-linux-next` crashes with
`AppArmor DENIED ... userns_create`. That attribute forces `auto-connect: no` snap-store-wide
(Canonical policy, not our config), so **every sideloaded/local install needs a manual**
`sudo snap connect figma-linux-next:browser-support` **after `snap install --dangerous`** —
this is not fixable from `builder.json`; it only goes away once the snap is published through
Snap Store review (which grants a store-side auto-connect exception for vetted publishers).

Debug new denials on the install machine with `sudo snappy-debug` (tails
`journalctl`/`syslog` and explains each `AppArmor`/`seccomp` line). Known-noise entries,
safe to ignore:
- `seccomp` denials for `sched_setaffinity` / `setpriority` — Chromium scheduling hints
- AppArmor denials in a *different* snap's profile (e.g. `mattermost-desktop`, or
  `rsyslogd` inside a `lxd-workshop.*` namespace) — unrelated process, not our app
- `dbus_method_call` to `org.bluez` (`GetManagedObjects`) — Web Bluetooth probing; only
  matters if a `bluez` plug/feature is ever added
- `open` denials on `/etc/vulkan/icd.d/` and `/etc/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/` — no snapd
  interface exposes this host path under strict confinement (the `opengl` interface only
  covers `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/*nvidia*.json` via `hostfs`); Chromium/ANGLE falls back
  to non-Vulkan GL rendering automatically, there is no fix available under strict
- `posix_mqueue` `getattr` on `/` — Chromium crash-handler IPC probing, non-fatal

Denials that ARE real bugs (fix by adding the plug to `snapcraft.core24.plugs`):
- reads on `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/host.conf`, `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`, or
  `AF_INET`/`AF_INET6` socket `create` denials → missing `network` plug
- `listen`/`accept4` seccomp denials, or the Figma MCP (`:3845`) / CDP (`:9222`) listeners
  never coming up at all → missing `network-bind` plug. `network` only covers the client
  role (connect out); a snap opening its own listening socket needs `network-bind` too —
  unrelated to which port it's on, and loopback-only sockets need it just the same as a
  public one. Any unconfined process on the host (e.g. `chrome-figma`/browser tooling) can
  still dial in from outside the snap once the socket is bound — confinement gates what the
  snap process can do, not who connects to a socket it already opened.
- reads under the user's home directory outside `$SNAP_USER_DATA` (breaks opening `.fig`
  files via a file picker) → missing `home` plug
- audio denials → missing `audio-playback` / `pulseaudio` plugs

Verify what's actually connected on the install machine with `snap connections
figma-linux-next` — plugs with `Notes: manual` need the explicit `snap connect` above;
everything else should show `-` (auto-connected).

## Two `package.json` Files — Keep in Sync

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | Dev manifest — all deps + devDeps |
| `src/package.json` | **Production manifest** — runtime deps only, copied to `dist/` |

When bumping a runtime dep version: update **both**. Dev-only deps (vite, eslint, playwright…) go in root only.

---

## Branching Strategy

```
staging  ←── all features, fixes, and daily work
   ↓ PR (CI must pass, 0 approvals required)
  dev     ←── stable, protected — merge only via PR from staging
```

- **`dev`** is branch-protected: no direct pushes, no force pushes, CI required
- **`staging`** is where all work happens, including version bumps
- Tags are created on `staging` **locally**, but pushed to remote **only after** staging merges to dev
- `enforce_admins: false` — owner can bypass in emergencies

---

## Release Flow (step by step)

> **Rule:** tag push triggers the release. The tag must be pushed **after** staging is merged into dev — so release only goes out when dev is already updated.

### 1. Prepare staging
```bash
# Ensure staging is clean and all changes are committed
git status
git push origin staging
```

### 2. Update CHANGELOG.md
Add a `## [X.Y.Z]` section at the top with the new version's changes.
Commit it: `git commit -m "chore(release): update CHANGELOG for vX.Y.Z"`

### 3. Bump version on staging (local tag only)
```bash
perl scripts/bump_version.pl X.Y.Z
# Creates: version bump commit + vX.Y.Z tag LOCALLY on staging
# Verify package.json and src/package.json both show X.Y.Z
```

### 4. Push staging branch only (NOT the tag yet)
```bash
git push origin staging
# Do NOT push the tag here — release must not go out before dev is updated
```

### 5. Create PR: staging → dev
```bash
gh pr create --base dev --head staging \
  --title "chore(release): vX.Y.Z" \
  --body "Merge staging into dev for vX.Y.Z release."
```

### 6. Wait for CI, merge PR
CI runs unit tests on the PR. Once green — merge.

### 7. Push the tag — this triggers the release
```bash
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```
⚠️ **Only now** does `release.yml` trigger. At this point dev is already updated.
- Builds all 11 packages (deb×2, rpm×2, AppImage×2, zip×2, pacman×1, snap×2)
- Creates GitHub Release with release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- Pushes updated PKGBUILD to AUR

---

- [ ] PR created: staging → dev
- [ ] CI green on PR
- [ ] PR merged
- [ ] `git push origin vX.Y.Z` — only now; this is what triggers `release.yml`
- [ ] GitHub Release visible at `github.com/arximus88/figma-linux-next/releases`
- [ ] AUR updated: `https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/figma-linux-next`

## CI/CD Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `release.yml` | Tag `v*.*.*` pushed | Build all 11 packages, GitHub Release, AUR push |
| `ci.yml` | Push/PR to `dev`/`staging` | Type check, lint, unit tests |
| `remove_artefacts.yml` | Manual | Clean up old CI artifacts |

Only these three exist. `push_aur_dev_git.yml` was deleted in `3c3a762`; the
`figma-linux-next-dev-git` AUR package has no automation.

### release.yml jobs

```
build-x64 (ubuntu-latest)
  apt: rpm fakeroot
  bunx electron-builder → deb, rpm, AppImage, zip (x64)

build-arm64 (ubuntu-24.04-arm)
  apt: rpm fakeroot
  bunx electron-builder → deb, rpm, AppImage, zip (arm64)

build-pacman (archlinux container)
  pacman: bun nodejs base-devel fakeroot libxcrypt-compat
  bunx electron-builder → .pacman (x64 only)

build-snap-x64 (ubuntu-latest, canonical/setup-lxd@v1 + snapcraft)
  bunx electron-builder → snap (x64, LXD-isolated build)

build-snap-arm64 (ubuntu-24.04-arm, canonical/setup-lxd@v1 + snapcraft)
  bunx electron-builder → snap (arm64, LXD-isolated build)

release (needs all build-* and build-snap-* jobs)
  merge artifacts → SHA256SUMS → softprops/action-gh-release@v2
  release notes extracted from CHANGELOG.md

aur (needs release, archlinux container)
  SSH key from ID_RSA secret → git clone aur.archlinux.org/figma-linux-next
  update PKGBUILD (pkgver + sha256 via scripts/update_pkgbuild_sha256.py)
  makepkg --printsrcinfo → .SRCINFO (runs as non-root 'builder' user)
  git push → AUR

aur-bin (needs release, archlinux container)
  same, against figma-linux-next-bin, hashing the release zip

flake (needs release, RELEASE_PAT)
  checkout dev → sha256 of both release zips → SRI
  scripts/update_flake_release.py VERSION SHA_X64 SHA_ARM64 flake.nix
  commit + push → dev, then the same on staging
```

**`aur`, `aur-bin` and `flake` skip pre-release tags.** All three carry
`if: !contains(ref_name, '-rc') && !contains(..., '-alpha') && !contains(..., '-beta')`.
Tagging `v0.16.0-rc1` publishes a GitHub Release and nothing else — AUR keeps serving
the last stable and `flake.nix` keeps its previous pin. That is intended; a pre-release
must not become what `nix build` or `pacman -S` hands a user.

**flake.nix is CI-owned.** Version and hashes live in one `release = { … }` block and are
rewritten together — the hashes only exist after the binaries are built, so this cannot be
part of `bump_version.pl`. Editing the version there by hand produces a flake that names one
release while carrying another's hashes, which fails every `nix build`.

`dev` is written first because Nix resolves the flake from the default branch. That needs
`RELEASE_PAT` (fine-grained, `Contents: write`, expires **2027-08-05**) — `GITHUB_TOKEN`
cannot push to a protected branch. A 403 on that push means the token expired; everything
else in the release is already published by then.

---

## AUR Repository

Remotes: `ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/figma-linux-next.git` and `…/figma-linux-next-bin.git`

**CI owns both repos.** The `aur` and `aur-bin` jobs clone from AUR fresh on every tagged
release, rewrite their fields, and push. Nothing local is consulted.

⚠️ **Never push from a long-lived local clone.** It falls behind by one release every time
CI runs, and pushing it rolls AUR back that far — CI will not notice, because its next run
clones whatever is there and edits it in place. A clone under `/home/arx/aur/` was five
releases stale (0.13.1 vs 0.15.0 live) before this was caught. For any manual edit, clone
into a throwaway directory:

```bash
cd $(mktemp -d)
git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/figma-linux-next.git && cd figma-linux-next
# edit PKGBUILD
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO    # regenerate per commit; .SRCINFO must match PKGBUILD
git commit -am "…" && git push
```

Read-only checks work over HTTPS (`https://aur.archlinux.org/figma-linux-next.git`) and the
RPC API, which is the fastest way to see what is actually published:

```bash
curl -s 'https://aur.archlinux.org/rpc/v5/info?arg[]=figma-linux-next' | python3 -m json.tool
```

During AUR maintenance the **SSH endpoint alone** goes down — `git push` fails with
"The AUR is down due to maintenance" while the web UI returns 200 and HTTPS git still
serves reads. A working website says nothing about whether you can push.

**What CI rewrites:** `pkgver`, `pkgrel`, `sha256sums`, and `license` (from `package.json`).
Every other field — `conflicts`, `depends`, `provides`, `optdepends`, `package()` — is
whatever the AUR repo already contains, so those only ever change by a manual push.

**PKGBUILD sources:** tarball from GitHub + `figma-linux-next.desktop` + `figma-linux-next-launcher.sh`
**sha256sums:** first entry = tarball sha256, others = SKIP (local files)

## Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Used for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Releases API | Automatic, no setup needed |
| `ID_RSA` (base64) | SSH key for AUR push | CI-dedicated key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519_aur_ci`), registered on AUR only |
| `USER_NAME` | Git committer name for AUR + flake commits | e.g. `Borys Kharchenko` |
| `EMAIL` | Git committer email for AUR + flake commits | |
| `RELEASE_PAT` | Pushing the pinned `flake.nix` to protected `dev` | Fine-grained, `Contents: write`, this repo only. Created 2026-08-05, **expires 2027-08-05**. Regenerate with `gh secret set RELEASE_PAT`. |

**SSH key setup:** CI uses a dedicated key separate from personal key.
- Personal key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (GitHub + AUR personal access)
- CI key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_aur_ci` (AUR only, base64 stored in `ID_RSA` secret)

**Encoding for GitHub Secret:** `base64 -w0 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_aur_ci` — copy output WITHOUT trailing `%` (zsh prompt artifact).

## Workflow Validation

Always validate before pushing workflow changes:
```bash
/home/arx/go/bin/actionlint .github/workflows/release.yml
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/release.yml'))"
```

Common pitfalls:
- Multi-line Python in `run: |` — use external script (`scripts/update_pkgbuild_sha256.py`) instead
- `$1` in perl regex inside double-quoted shell string — shell eats it, use Python instead
- `bunx electron-builder` not `electron-builder` (not in PATH in CI)
- archlinux container needs `libxcrypt-compat` for fpm/ruby
- `makepkg --printsrcinfo` requires non-root user — use `useradd -m builder && su builder -c`
- SSH `known_hosts` in archlinux container: use `/root/.ssh/` explicitly, set `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`
- Snap CI jobs need `canonical/setup-lxd@v1` (before `snapcraft`) — Multipass needs nested
  virtualisation GitHub-hosted runners don't have; LXD is container-based and works
